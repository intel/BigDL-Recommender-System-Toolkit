# Building Recommender Systems with Intel® Recsys Toolkit

Use Intel® Recsys Toolkit, also known as BigDL Friesian, to easily build large-scale distributed training and online serving
pipelines for modern recommender systems. This page demonstrates how to use this toolkit to build a recommendation solution for the Wide & Deep Learning workflow.

Check out more toolkits and reference implementations in the [Developer Catalog](https://developer.intel.com/aireferenceimplementations).

## Overview
Building an end-to-end recommender system that meets production demands from scratch could be rather challenging.
Intel® Recsys Toolkit, i.e. BigDL Friesian, can greatly help relieve the efforts of building distributed offline training
and online serving pipelines. The recommendation solutions built with the toolkit are optimized on Intel® Xeon
and could be directly deployed on existing large clusters to handle production big data.

Highlights and benefits of Intel® Recsys Toolkit are as follows:

- Provide various built-in distributed feature engineering operations to efficiently process user and item features.
- Support the distributed training of any standard TensorFlow or PyTorch model. 
- Implement a complete, highly available and scalable pipeline for online serving (including recall and ranking) with low latency.
- Include out-of-box reference use cases of many popular recommendation algorithms.

Intel® Recsys Toolkit is a domain-specific submodule named Friesian in BigDL focusing on recommendation workloads, visit the BigDL Friesian [GitHub repository](https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL/tree/main/python/friesian) and
[documentation page](https://bigdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/Friesian/index.html) for more details.

## Hardware Requirements

## How it Works

<img src="https://github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL/blob/main/scala/friesian/src/main/resources/images/architecture.png" width="80%" />

The architecture above illustrates the main components in Intel® Recsys Toolkit.

- The offline training workflow is implemented based on Spark, Ray and BigDL to efficiently scale the data processing and DNN model training on large Xeon clusters.
- The nearline workflow loads the features into the key-value store and builds the index for vector search.
- The online serving workflow is implemented based on gRPC and HTTP, which consists of Recall, Ranking, Feature and Recommender services. The Recall Service integrates Intel® Optimized Faiss to significantly speed up the vector search step.

## How To Run

### 1. Download the Datasets

This workflow of the toolkit uses the [Twitter Recsys Challenge 2021 dataset](http://www.recsyschallenge.com/2021/) as an example. In this dataset, each record contains the tweet along with engagement features, user features, and tweet features.

The original dataset includes 46 million users and 340 million tweets (items). Alternatively, here we provide a script to generate some dummy data for this dataset. In the running command below, you can specify the number of records to generate and the output folder respectively.

```
cd python/friesian/example/wnd/recsys2021
mkdir recsys_data

# You can modify the number of records and the output folder when running the script
python generate_dummy_data.py 100000 recsys_data/
```

### 2. Run Training Workflow

The training workflow of Intel® Recsys Toolkit will preprocess the dataset, train the [Wide & Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07792) model (for ranking) and two-tower model (for embeddings) with the processed data.

Use these commands to run the training workflow:

- Data processing:
```
python wnd_preprocess_recsys.py \
    --executor_cores 8 \
    --executor_memory 6g \
    --data_dir recsys_data \
    --cross_sizes 600
```
- Wide & Deep model training:
```
python wnd_train_recsys.py \
    --backend spark \
    --executor_cores 8 \
    --executor_memory 6g \
    --data_dir recsys_data/preprocessed \
    --model_dir recsys_wnd \
    --batch_size 3200 \
    --epoch 5 \
    --learning_rate 1e-4 \
    --early_stopping 3
```
- Two-tower model training:
```
cd ../../two_tower
python train_2tower.py \
    --backend spark \
    --executor_cores 8 \
    --executor_memory 6g \
    --data_dir ../wnd/recsys2021/recsys_data/preprocessed \
    --model_dir recsys_2tower \
    --batch_size 8000
```

- Two-tower model inference for user and item embeddings:
```
python predict_2tower.py \
    --backend spark \
    --executor_cores 8 \
    --executor_memory 6g \
    --data_dir ../wnd/recsys2021/recsys_data/preprocessed \
    --model_dir recsys_2tower \
    --batch_size 8000
```
In the above commands, `--executor_cores` and `--executor_memory` indicate the number of cores and amount of memory used to run the program.
You can properly set them according to your environment and resources.

**Expected Training Workflow Output**

Check out the processed data and saved models after the training:
```
ll recsys_2tower

cd ../wnd/recsys2021
ll recsys_data/preprocessed

### 3. Run Online Serving Pipeline Using Docker

After completing the training pipeline, you can use the trained model to deploy and test the online serving pipeline of Intel® Recsys Toolkit.

You are highly recommended to run the online serving pipeline using our provided Docker image as instructed in this section.

Note that we have already prepared scripts to easily launch the Docker containers for online serving. You need to run the following steps on **bare metal** to start the services. If you run the training pipeline in the Docker image, first type `Ctrl+D` or `exit` to exit the container and go back to your development system.


**a. Set Up Docker Image**

Pull the provided Docker image:

```
docker pull intelanalytics/friesian-serving:2.2.0-SNAPSHOT
```


**b. Download & install redis**

```bash
wget https://github.com/redis/redis/archive/7.2-rc1.tar.gz
tar -xzf 7.2-rc1.tar.gz
cd redis-7.2-rc1 && make
src/redis-server &
```

**c. Prepare model and features**

Copy the trained model and processed features to the folder where we run the serving scripts.

```bash
cd ~/work/BigDL/
cp -r python/friesian/example/wnd/recsys2021/recsys_wnd scala/friesian/
cp -r python/friesian/example/wnd/recsys2021/recsys_data/preprocessed/*.parquet scala/friesian/
cd scala/friesian/
```

**d. Run Workflow**

1. Flush all the key-values in the redis and check the initial redis status:
```bash
redis-cli flushall

redis-cli info keyspace
```

Output:
```bash
# Keyspace
```

2. Run the following script to launch the nearline pipeline:
```bash
bash scripts/run_nearline.sh
```

3. Check the redis-server status:
```bash
redis-cli info keyspace
```
Output:
```bash
# Keyspace
db0:keys=500003,expires=0,avg_ttl=0
```

Check the existence of the generated [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) index for vector search:
```bash
ls -la item_128.idx
```

4. If your environment requires a proxy to access the Internet, unset it before running the online pipeline:
```bash
unset http_proxy https_proxy
```

Run the following script to launch the online pipeline:
```bash
bash scripts/run_online.sh
```

5. Check the status of the containers:
```bash
docker container ls
```
There should be 5 containers running:
- `recommender_http`: The recommender service to handle requests.
- `recall`: The recall service for vector search.
- `feature_recall`: The feature service for embeddings.
- `feature`: The feature service for user and item features.
- `ranking`: The ranking service for model inference.

6. Confirm the application is accessible
```bash
# Recommend for user 20
curl http://localhost:8000/recommender/recommend/20

# Recommend for user 99999
curl http://localhost:8000/recommender/recommend/99999
```
Output:
```bash
{
  "ids" : [ 49498, 90939, 9237, 37407, 18638, 10772, 83555, 1175, 41118, 56338 ],
  "probs" : [ 0.8125731, 0.7951641, 0.78238714, 0.7734338, 0.7725358, 0.7724836, 0.7694705, 0.76804805, 0.76270276, 0.76186526 ],
  "success" : true,
  "errorCode" : null,
  "errorMsg" : null
}
```
